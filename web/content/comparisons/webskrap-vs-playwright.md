# WebSkrap vs Playwright for Python Web Scraping

Playwright is a powerful browser automation library. WebSkrap builds on top of Playwright and Patchright to provide a higher-level Python web scraping toolkit.

## When Playwright is enough

Use Playwright directly when you need full low-level browser control and want to write the whole scraping workflow yourself.

```python
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
```

This is ideal for custom browser automation, testing flows, or highly specific scraping logic.

## What WebSkrap adds

WebSkrap packages common scraping needs into a smaller API:

| Capability | Playwright | WebSkrap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser automation | Yes | Yes, via Playwright/Patchright |
| One-shot fetch result object | Manual | Built in |
| Persistent scraping sessions | Manual setup | Built in |
| Browser profiles | Manual setup | Built in |
| Resource routing presets | Manual setup | Built in |
| Patchright stealth path | Separate integration | Built in |
| MCP server for agents | Manual | Built in |
| CLI JSON fetch output | Manual | Built in |

## Example WebSkrap fetch

```python
import asyncio
from webskrap import WebSkrapClient

async def main() -> None:
    async with WebSkrapClient() as client:
        result = await client.fetch("https://example.com")
        print(result.title)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Recommendation

Use Playwright directly when you need total browser control. Use WebSkrap when you want a Python web scraping package with sensible defaults, reusable sessions, profiles, resource policy, CLI output, and MCP tools.
