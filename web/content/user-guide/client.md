# Client

`WebSkrapClient` owns the Playwright lifecycle.

Use it as an async context manager:

```python
import asyncio

from webskrap import WebSkrapClient


async def main() -> None:
    async with WebSkrapClient() as client:
        result = await client.fetch("https://example.com")
    print(result.status)


asyncio.run(main())
```

You can also manage the lifecycle manually when embedding WebSkrap in a larger
async application:

```python
client = WebSkrapClient()
await client.start()
try:
    result = await client.fetch("https://example.com")
finally:
    await client.close()
```

## One-shot fetch

`client.fetch()` creates a temporary browser session, opens the page, collects the response data, then closes that temporary session.

```python
result = await client.fetch(
    "https://example.com",
    wait_until="domcontentloaded",
    screenshot="example.png",
)
```

Use `client.session()` when you want to keep browser state or keep a headed browser open.

### Wait states

`wait_until` is passed to Playwright navigation and supports:

| Value | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `commit` | You only need the navigation to begin. |
| `domcontentloaded` | You need parsed HTML and want a fast default. |
| `load` | You need regular page assets to finish loading. |
| `networkidle` | You need a quiet network, usually for JS-heavy pages. |

For pages with long-polling or analytics requests, `networkidle` can be slower
or less reliable than `domcontentloaded` plus an explicit page wait in a session.

### Screenshots and output

The Python API returns page HTML in `result.text` by default. Pass
`text_only=True` when you want readable body text instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

result = await client.fetch("https://example.com", screenshot="example.png")
Path("example.html").write_text(result.text, encoding="utf-8")
print(result.screenshot_path)

text_result = await client.fetch("https://example.com", text_only=True)
print(text_result.text)
```

Pass `screenshot=True` to let WebSkrap choose a timestamped file name in the
current working directory.

### Per-call config

Pass a `SessionConfig` for one request without changing the client's defaults:

```python
from webskrap import ResourcePolicy, SessionConfig

config = SessionConfig(
    headless=True,
    resource_policy=ResourcePolicy.LITE,
    navigation_timeout_ms=60_000,
)
result = await client.fetch("https://example.com", config=config)
```

## FetchResult

`FetchResult` includes:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | URL requested by the caller. |
| `final_url` | Page URL after redirects and navigation. |
| `status` | Main response HTTP status, or `None` when no response is available. |
| `ok` | `True` when status is 2xx or 3xx. |
| `headers` | Main response headers. |
| `text` | Final page HTML from `page.content()`. |
| `title` | Final document title. |
| `cookies` | Browser-context cookies visible after the fetch. |
| `timings` | Timing data, currently including `elapsed_ms`. |
| `screenshot_path` | Screenshot path when screenshot capture was requested. |

Check `status` before assuming `headers` or HTTP semantics exist:

```python
if result.status is None:
    print("Navigation did not return a main response")
elif result.ok:
    print("Loaded", result.final_url)
else:
    print("HTTP error", result.status)
```
